## 3 Ideas Each
### Jeremy
- **Immortalise your museum visit**: Visitors can scan artefacts and plaques that they find interesting and at the end of the visit turn it into a cohesive story/painting/comic centred around their unique experience around the museum. Makes use of generative AI and any information the user provides to make it more personal and memorable. (obviously precautions with cultural appropriation or depicting a user on the wrong side of history).
- **Vibrotactile navigation device / glove / bracelet**: could this be used in a museum to help people stay immersed in their surroundings without having to worry about looking at a map or a screen. Could it be used to help children find their parents and vice-versa? Could buzz if child is a certain distance away and provide navigation via vibration or looking back to a screen.
- **Museum Drift Table**: Drift table to provide a ludic experience (purely playful / exploratory. Non-utilitarian). It's a coffee table with a small screen with a birdseye view of the uk. You can drift to new places by placing objects around the table to control direction and speed. It doesn't come with a specific goal but does encourage conversations and the act of exploring. Could an adaptation of this be used in museums, potentially with more information on screen about a region and how different exhibits link together?
### Liam
- **Stolen or Not**: A device that you can point at an artifact in a museum and an indicator will simply tell you if that item was stolen or not.
- **Plaque to Braille Converter**: A device that can convert text on an artifacts plaque into braille so that it can be read by a person who is visually impaired. (prob not feasible for us to build though)
- **Digital Scavenger Hunt**: A device used whilst at the museum that you can take around and attempt to find items, once an item is found tap the device against it, and it will add it to your collection. Completeing your collection can be used for points or rewards based on the museum.
### Himanshu
- **Idea Name 1**: There are feet pedals on the ground and you press it to draw something on the wall in an art museuem.
- **Idea Name 2**: You become a conductor and you have a stick and you move it around to make music.
- **Idea Name 3**: You have a flask and you mix "chemicals" to get sounds and visual feedback.
### Jason
- **Projected museum piece**: Projections onto a display can allow users to interact with the item and pick it up. As the user's hands move as they pick it up the projections continue to display on their hands as if the item is in your hand.
- **Haptic tour guide**: A vibration device possibly around the waist can point a user on a coherent tour around the museum. It would point the user to the next item to go to with directional vibrations.
- **Interactive holographic display**: Use the vibrating display to show an museum item but the vibrations can be use to give the rigidity of the item. 
### Umad
- **See it to believe it** An Augmented reality glasses that visualises extinct animals showing all their characteristics to help visitors really immerse themselves in the experience 
- **Feel it to believe it**: Touch sensitive information boards that would help you feel what type of environment the artefact used to be in or how the skin or characteristics of an animal would feel
- **Museum Passport**: A device that collects stamps after you have visited and tested your knowledge of the artefacts
