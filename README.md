- **Digital Scavenger Hunt**: A device used whilst at the museum that you can take around and attempt to find items, once an item is found tap the device against it, and it will add it to your collection. Completeing your collection can be used for points or rewards based on the museum.

- **Projected museum piece**: Projections onto a display can allow users to interact with the item and pick it up. As the user's hands move as they pick it up the projections continue to display on their hands as if the item is in your hand.
- **Haptic tour guide**: A vibration device possibly around the waist can point a user on a coherent tour around the museum. It would point the user to the next item to go to with directional vibrations.
- **Interactive holographic display**: Use the vibrating display to show an museum item but the vibrations can be use to give the rigidity of the item. 
### Umad

- **Feel it to believe it**: Touch sensitive information boards that would help you feel what type of environment the artefact used to be in or how the skin or characteristics of an animal would feel
- **Museum Passport**: A device that collects stamps after you have visited and tested your knowledge of the artefacts
