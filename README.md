## Abstract Draft 1 
The most common way for visually impaired people to navigate a museum is through comprehensive audio descriptions. 
These audio descriptions eliminate another sense for visually impaired people leaving them feeling isolated from their physical environment and the people within it [source]. 
Wearable technology can enable people to absorb textual information without the need for additional senses via mediums such as haptic morse code [link], however no work currently explores haptic transmission of text via braille which may offer both speed and learnability advantages over morse code for braille-familiar users. 
We propose a wearable bracelet that transmits a vibrational adaptation of braille patterns and sequences to enable museum visitors to passively absorb information from exhibits. 
Beyond the museum, this medium could be introduced to general life contexts as an alternative to audio and traditional braille such as passively receiving text messages without opening your phone.
